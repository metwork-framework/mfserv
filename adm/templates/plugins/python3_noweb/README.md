## Introduction

This template is made for hosting Python3
without a web part (see the `python3_flask` plugin template for example if you need a web app).

## How to play with it?

By default, the plugin will launch nothing.

You can install Python3 [PyPi](https://pypi.org) packages:

- with `pip` (after entering "your plugin" `plugin_env`)
- or by adding package names at the end of `python3_virtualenv_sources/requirements-to-freeze.txt` (and using the `make` command)

See "plugins guide" for more details.
