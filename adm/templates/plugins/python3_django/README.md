## Introduction

This template is made for building Python3 webservices/websites using
the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.

## How to play with it?

By default, you have a configured django project (same name as the plugin)
with one application `hello`.

Have a look to the `postinstall` script to see what we have configured (you can
change everything if you want).
