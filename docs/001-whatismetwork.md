# What is MetWork?

[MetWork Framework](https://metwork-framework.org) is an opensource system
for building and managing production grade applications or micro-services
(from development to operations).

!!! info "History"
    [MetWork Framework](https://metwork-framework.org) was originally built by [Météo-France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France)
    as the core of its weather forecasting workstation.

    This framework has been very successful within the organization, even for developing things far away from its original domain.
    It benefits from years of build and run experience for critical 24/7 meteorological systems.

    **Software and APIs powered by [MetWork Framework](https://metwork-framework.org) are used daily by
    hundreds of [Météo-France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France) forecasters and by millions of end-users.**

    [Météo-France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9t%C3%A9o-France) has released [MetWork Framework](https://metwork-framework.org) as an opensource software, under a very permissive BSD license.

    The whole framework, libraries and even management tools are now managed in a dedicated [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/metwork-framework).
