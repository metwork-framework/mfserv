          For mergify to merge automatically this PR,

          => you have to change the PR title to match conventional commit specification:

          ```
          regex: ^(build|chore|ci|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|fix|feat|fix|feat|feat!|fix!)(\([a-z]+\))?: .*$
          ```

          As the title will be used for the commit message (and so for changelog entry if `feat:` or `fix:`).

          Thank you for contributing to this project.

          But we don't accept pull requests on `master` branch as said in our
          contributing guide.

          => You have to change the base branch of your pull request to
          `integration` branch.

           It's very easy to do that by following this [github guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-base-branch-of-a-pull-request).

           Many thanks!
